description: An AI-powered real-time sign language translation system that enables seamless communication between deaf and hearing individuals

## Project Overview

Sign Language Bridge revolutionizes communication for the deaf community by providing real-time translation between sign language and spoken/written language. Using advanced computer vision and natural language processing, the system captures sign language gestures and converts them into text or speech, while also translating spoken words into animated sign language.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest hurdle was developing a system that could accurately capture and interpret the nuanced movements of sign language in real-time, including facial expressions and hand positions. We implemented a novel approach using 3D motion tracking and contextual understanding to achieve high accuracy in varied lighting conditions.
