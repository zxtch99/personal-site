## Project Overview

AccessGuard is a revolutionary web security platform that combines enterprise-grade protection with built-in accessibility compliance checking. The system ensures websites remain secure while maintaining full accessibility, automatically detecting and suggesting fixes for WCAG violations while protecting against security threats.

## Technical Challenges

The primary challenge was implementing security measures that wouldn't interfere with assistive technologies. We developed an innovative approach that maintains strict security while ensuring screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility tools function perfectly, even during security challenges like CAPTCHA verification.
